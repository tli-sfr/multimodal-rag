and artificial intelligence (AI).[3] Ng was a cofounder
and head of Google Brain and was the former Chief
Scientist at Baidu, building the company's Artificial
Intelligence Group into a team of several thousand
people.[4]
Ng is an adjunct professor at Stanford University
(formerly associate professor and Director of its
Stanford AI Lab or SAIL). Ng has also worked in the
field of online education, cofounding Coursera and
DeepLearning.AI.[5] He has spearheaded many efforts
to "democratize deep learning" teaching over 8 million
students through his online courses.[6][3][7] Ng is
renowned globally in computer science, recognized in
Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2012
and Fast Company's Most Creative People in 2014. His
influence extends to being named in the Time100 AI
Most Influential People in 2023.[7]
In 2018, he launched and currently heads the AI Fund,
initially a $175-million investment fund for backing
artificial intelligence startups. He has founded Landing
AI, which provides AI-powered SaaS products.[8]
On April 11, 2024, Amazon announced the appointment
of Ng to its board of directors.[9]
Ng was born in London,[10] in 1976 to Ronald Paul Ng, a
hematologist and lecturer at UCL Medical School, and
Tisa Ho, an arts administrator working at the London
Film Festival.[11][12][13] His parents were both
immigrants from Hong Kong. He has at least one
brother.[12] Ng and his family moved back to Hong

he began learning the basics of programming through
some books. In 1984 he and his family moved to
Singapore.[10] Ng attended and graduated from Raffles
Institution.[14] During his high school years, he
demonstrated exceptional mathematical ability,
winning a Silver Medal at the International
Mathematical Olympiad.[15]
In 1997, he earned his undergraduate degree with a
triple major in computer science, statistics, and
economics from Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Between 1996 and 1998 he
also conducted research on reinforcement learning,
model selection, and feature selection at the AT&T Bell
Labs.[16]
In 1998, Ng earned his master's degree in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
Cambridge, Massachusetts. At MIT, he built the first
publicly available, automatically indexed web-search
engine for research papers on the web. It was a
precursor to CiteSeerX/ResearchIndex, but specialized
in machine learning.[16]
In 2002, he received his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in
Computer Science from the University of California,
Berkeley, under the supervision of Michael I. Jordan.
His thesis is titled "Shaping and policy search in
reinforcement learning" and is well-cited to this
day.[16][17]
He started working as an assistant professor at Stanford
University in 2002 and as an associate professor in
2009.[18]
He currently lives in Los Altos Hills, California. In 2014,
he married Carol E. Reiley.[19] They have two children: a
daughter born in 2019[20] and a son born in 2021.[21]
The MIT Technology Review named Ng and Reiley an
"AI power couple".[22][23]
